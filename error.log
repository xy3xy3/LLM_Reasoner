1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "="
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either:
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Corrector
## Goals
- Enhance the compatibility of First-order Logic (FOL) formulas with formal verification tools by ensuring syntactical correctness and adherence to formal logic syntax.
- Automatically identify and suggest corrections for common syntax errors in FOL formulas to facilitate their processing by logic verifiers.
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"
## Output format

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either:

- Automatically identify and suggest corrections for common syntax errors in FOL formulas to facilitate their processing by logic verifiers.
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either:

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Corrector
## Goals
- Enhance the compatibility of First-order Logic (FOL) formulas with formal verification tools by ensuring syntactical correctness and adherence to formal logic syntax.
- Automatically identify and suggest corrections for common syntax errors in FOL formulas to facilitate their processing by logic verifiers.
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"
## Output format

1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Corrector
## Goals
- Enhance the compatibility of First-order Logic (FOL) formulas with formal verification tools by ensuring syntactical correctness and adherence to formal logic syntax.
- Automatically identify and suggest corrections for common syntax errors in FOL formulas to facilitate their processing by logic verifiers.
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"
## Output format

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either:

# Role: Logic Corrector
## Goals
- Enhance the compatibility of First-order Logic (FOL) formulas with formal verification tools by ensuring syntactical correctness and adherence to formal logic syntax.
- Automatically identify and suggest corrections for common syntax errors in FOL formulas to facilitate their processing by logic verifiers.
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"
## Output format
Use <FOL> and </FOL> to wrap the FOL formulas.
Each line in the tag should be a single FOL formula.
You can analyze task during your output.But don't use natural language in the final <FOL> tag.
Only signal <FOL> can be in your reply.

2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

There are three methods to solve this problem. Please ascertain the correct approach based on the context:
1. One could examine whether predicates with similar meanings appear between different lines. If the meanings are similar and the number of predicate parameters is consistent, they can be replaced with the same one.
2. If the current line's variable domain can contains information identical to the predicate, it can be omitted. This is because the variable domain implicitly contains the attribute described by the predicate.
3. If the current line's predicate is necessary, one may integrate predicates that appear only once into other expressions where other domains contain this infomation..

Error: Predicate 'EndowmentValue' has inconsistent arity in premises and conclusion.
Firstly,follow the rules above and reply your idea about the error message.
Secondly,write 6 FOL formulas after fixed in the following tag <FOL> which like `<FOL>Your answer</FOL>`.

1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

# Role: Logic Translater
## For FOL rule generation
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You *SHOULD NEVER USE* the following symbols for FOL: "", "̸=", "%", "=" 
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED 
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement 
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL 
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: 
(1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x", "y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"
